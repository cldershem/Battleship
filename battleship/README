Known bugs:
    enter letters exits poorly
    randomly ships[] will have extra numbers at end
Feature requests:
    multiplayer - working on it
    bigger ships - most likely after multiplayer

fixed
    sinking does not print new map
    sinking a ship does not give you extra turns
        well it does but it's a for loop so it don't matter
    printing the S for ship is causing an error - commented
